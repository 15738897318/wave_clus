Wave_clus
=========

Introduction
------------

Wave_clus is a fast and unsupervised algorithm for spike detection and sorting using wavelets and super-paramagnetic clustering. Although it gives a first unsupervised solution, this can be further modified according to
the experimentersâ€™ preference (semi-automatic sorting). Wave_clus is free (and therefore without any warranty) for any non commercial applications. For
any commercial application please contact the author (rqqg1@le.ac.uk).


Usage
-----

#### Requirements
Wave_clus runs under windows, linux and Mac. It requires matlab 6.5 (R13) or higher. It uses the function cluster.exe, provided by Eytan Domani, which is an executable that does the superparamagnetic clustering of the data. In the new release, the wavelet and the signal processing toolboxes are not necessary anymore
